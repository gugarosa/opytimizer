Welcome to Opytimizer's documentation!
=======================================

Did you ever reach a bottleneck in your computational experiments? Are you tired of selecting suitable parameters for a chosen technique? If yes, Opytimizer is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of meta-heuristic optimizations. From agents to a search space, from internal functions to external communication, we will foster all research related to optimizing stuff.

Use Opytimizer if you need a library or wish to:

* Create your own optimization algorithm.
* Design or use pre-loaded optimization tasks.
* Mix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem.
* Because it is fun to optimize things.

Opytimizer is compatible with: **Python 3.6+** and **PyPy 3.5**.
